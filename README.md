## Why DiceStack?

Most WordPress sites run a dozen plugins — one for caching, one for security, one for SEO, another for backups — each adding weight, cost, and conflicts. **DiceStack replaces that whole stack** with one free, modular toolkit:

- **🧩 185 tools, one install** — security, performance, SEO, WooCommerce, media, marketing, admin, accessibility and more.
- **⚡ Zero bloat by design** — every tool is off until you enable it, and disabled tools load **no PHP, JS, or CSS**. The dashboard shows the exact RAM / JS / DB cost of each tool *before* you turn it on.
- **💯 100% free, forever** — no "Pro" upsell, no locked features, no nag screens.
- **🛡️ Safe Mode & isolation** — a failing tool auto-disables itself instead of taking down your site.
- **🤝 Conflict-aware** — DiceStack detects plugins you already run (e.g. an SEO or caching plugin) and warns you before enabling an overlapping tool.
- **🏢 Agency Mode** — per-tool control and a 1-click "Recommended setup" that scans your site and enables the right essentials.

## How it works

DiceStack uses a **modular architecture**: each tool is a self-contained module that is only loaded when you enable it.

- Disabled module → **0 KB** PHP/JS/CSS, **0** extra DB queries.
- Each card in the dashboard shows the tool's footprint *(e.g. "If on: +12 KB")* so you make informed choices.
- Your enabled/disabled choices **persist across updates** — updating the plugin never re-enables tools or loses settings.

---

## Requirements

- **WordPress** 6.0 or higher
- **PHP** 7.4 or higher
- Some tools need server capabilities (e.g. Redis/Memcached for object cache, Imagick for image optimization, ZipArchive for backups) — DiceStack detects these and clearly marks any tool your server can't run.

## FAQ

**Is there a free all-in-one WordPress plugin?**
Yes — DiceStack is a completely free all-in-one WordPress plugin. One install gives you 185 modular tools for security, performance, SEO, WooCommerce, caching, backups and more, with no premium tier and no upsell.

**What's a good free alternative to paid WordPress suites?**
DiceStack replaces a whole stack of separate (and often paid) plugins — caching, security, SEO, backups, forms and an object cache — with one lightweight dashboard. You enable only the tools you need, and disabled tools load zero code, so your site stays fast.

**Is DiceStack a free alternative to WP Rocket, Wordfence, or Yoast?**
Yes. DiceStack includes free, built-in tools that cover caching (like WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache), security (like Wordfence or Sucuri), SEO (like Yoast or All in One SEO), backups (like UpdraftPlus), image optimization (like Smush) and forms (like WPForms) — so one free install can replace several paid plugins. See the comparison table above.

**Is DiceStack really free?**
Yes — every one of the 185 tools is free. There is no premium tier or paid add-on.

**Will it slow my site down?**
No. Tools you don't enable load nothing at all. Enabling the caching and optimization tools typically makes sites **faster**.

**Will it conflict with my existing SEO / caching / security plugin?**
DiceStack detects common plugins and warns you before you enable a tool that overlaps, so you can avoid double-handling.

**Do I need WooCommerce?**
Only for the WooCommerce category. Those tools stay dormant (and clearly marked "Needs WooCommerce") until WooCommerce is active.

**What happens to my settings when I update?**
Nothing changes — enabled tools stay enabled, disabled stay disabled, and all settings are preserved.
